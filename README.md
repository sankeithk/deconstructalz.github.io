Deconstructing Alzheimer's disease with neurotransmitter maps

Welcome!

### WIP ###

This GitHub repo is to document the work being conducted at Dr Greg Scott's Computational Neurology Group, taking patterns of grey matter atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and convertng them to a series of beta coefficients via a series of neurotransmitter maps (averaged PET scans from healthy volunteers). 

We want to see what information these beta coefficients can tell us - can we use them to learn more about Alzheimer's disease?

Because science is about collaboration, I would like to credit the work conducted by the neuromaps team: these papers were particularly relevant to our research.
